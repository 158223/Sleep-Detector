# Sleep Detector
 A sleep detection algorithm with OpenCV, Python, and dlib

### Motivation
The algorithm consists of using computer vision to detect drowsiness. The algorithm could be used to detect drowsiness in drivers, in order to prevent accidents caused by the driver.

### Installing and running
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
python sleep_detector.py  --shape-predictor shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
```

### Inspiration
This algorithm consists of adapting the "[Eye blink detection](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/24/eye-blink-detection-opencv-python-dlib/)" developed by Adrian Rosebrock.
